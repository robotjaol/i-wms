# Sample Excel File Structure

This is a placeholder for the sample Excel file. The actual file should be created with the following structure:

## Sheet4 Structure (Required)

| Column | Header | Description | Example |
|--------|--------|-------------|---------|
| A | Fetch Station | Station where pallet is fetched | "Button Pallet Position Tube" |
| B | Deliver Station | Station where pallet is delivered | "Pallet GR Position Tube" |
| C | Date | Date of operation | "2024/01/15" |
| D | Start Time | Start time of operation | "2024/01/15 08:30:00" |
| E | Fetch Time | Time when pallet was fetched | "2024/01/15 08:35:00" |
| F | Delivery Time | Time when pallet was delivered | "2024/01/15 08:42:00" |

## Required Data Patterns

1. **Pallet GR Entries**: Must contain "Pallet GR" in the station names for filtering
2. **Time Format**: YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
3. **Station Types**: 
   - Button Pallet Position (Tube/Non-Tube)
   - Pallet GR Position (Tube/Non-Tube)
   - RMS A, RMS C
   - Loading Dock, Scanning, Supermarket

## Sample Data Rows

```
Fetch Station: "Button Pallet Position Tube"
Deliver Station: "Pallet GR Position Tube"
Start Time: "2024/01/15 08:30:00"
Fetch Time: "2024/01/15 08:35:00"
Delivery Time: "2024/01/15 08:42:00"
```

## Notes

- The system specifically looks for "Pallet GR" entries in the data
- Time calculations are performed between Start, Fetch, and Delivery times
- Shift analysis is based on time buckets (Morning: 6-14, Afternoon: 14-22, Night: 22-6)
- The processed output will include shift-wise aggregation and performance metrics
